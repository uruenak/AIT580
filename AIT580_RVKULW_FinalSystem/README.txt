AIT580 Team 9 has worked on a system to predict recidivism of inmates as part of our final project.
For this project, you will find 5 folders with the following:

Code: contains 3 IPYNB files needed to run our models. “AIT580RVKULW_Final” and “Random Forest Classifier - Final” can be downloaded in local, 
and then open in a Jupyter Lab or notebook. Most libraries used come with the installation of Anaconda, so if already set up, it should work as expected,
by running all the cells. The only exception is the ‘xgboost’ library. For this, you can download using the Anaconda prompt.
The “Recidivism_Autopilot_Binary_Sagemaker” file is to be used in AWS Sagemaker. To run, you can directly upload, or just copy the contents into a new
instance of a Jupyter Lab, using the Python 3 (Data Science) kernel. Once the files are loaded in S3, you can run an experiment, specifying the location
of the S3 bucket in which the input file is located, and where to save the output artifacts after the experiment is done.

Data: contains 1 csv file, “NIJ_s_Recidivism_Challenge_Training_Dataset”, which contains all the data used throughout the different notebooks.

Documents_Presentation: contains the project topic, abstract, and final presentation slides.

HtmlFileJupyter: contains 1 html file with all the outputs of the cells from the “AIT580RVKULW_Final” notebook.

TableauReport: contains 1 file with the link to the Tableau report developed for the project.
